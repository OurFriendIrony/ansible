          <desc>Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a &#34;rotofoil&#34;, which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled &#34;droid&#34; with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent&#39;s goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player&#39;s half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.</desc>

No wonder the gang members nicknamed this game &#34;Basketbrawl.&#34; To them, it&#39;s not a game -- it&#39;s a street fight. This premise kicks off Atari&#39;s action sports game for up to two players. The objective in Basketbrawl is to become the baddest gang in the town by winning the Basketbrawl tournament. To win, you must play three games against each of the five gangs in your city. Each time you move up to the next gang, you will play a team with more players and more dangerous weapons. Each game lasts six minutes -- out score you opponent by shooting more baskets. Each basket is worth two points. If the game is tied after six minutes, the first team to score wins</desc>

But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site. But watch out, egg-stealing creatures are everywhere!</desc>

As the puck slides across the smooth, icy surface, you take it at center ice, managing to break over the blue line to your opponent&#39;s right. Whoooossh. What reflexes! What speed!&#xA;&#xA;The spray of the ice on your face momentarily blinds you, but you continue to skate furiously, weaving towards the opposing goal. You can feel your challenger&#39;s hot breath on the back of your neck, as the distance between you grows smaller and smaller. But before he can manage to steal the puck, you swing your stick and whack -- it&#39;s a slapshot! The point is yours!&#xA;&#xA;Get three goals in a game, and it&#39;s a hat trick!</desc>

          <name>Tank Command</name>
          <desc>Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game!&#xA;&#xA;The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600&#39;?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don&#39;t worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.</desc>

Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles).

Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he&#39;s the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try not to run over him...yet).&#xA;&#xA;Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that&#39;s a lot of missiles!).&#xA;&#xA;After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</desc>

          <desc>Planet Smashers finally delivered an original 2D Shooter to the Pro System late in its life. Your spaceship, which oddly looks like an airplane, has the grave task of defending Earth from an alien armada. Planet Smashers has some nice features like level warp codes, laser upgrades, cloaking devices, and interesting bosses. You even have the burden of defending Earth&#39;s shield from asteroids and alien ships. The back of the box boasts, &#34;awesome sound effects&#34;, but the main laser noise is mind-numbingly irritating. After you defeat the game, you are treated to a text ending commanding you to play Alien Brigade, which makes little sense since you just defeated the alien mothership.</desc>
